# Supply Chain Next: Iteration Notes

## Vision

- Move from a simple, flat supply chain model to an enterprise-scale, extensible, and time-aware simulation.
- Support for factories, DCs, retails, trucks, ships, airplanes, SKUs, orders, events, and more.
- Enable advanced reasoning, optimization, and reward-based decision making.

## Key Design Principles

- **Normalized, modular data model** (see `supplyChainNext.ts`)
- **Time-stepped simulation** with event logging
- **Support for all asset types** (trucks, ships, airplanes, etc.)
- **Reward system** for optimization and explainability (see `Rewards.md`)
- **Scalable for large networks** (hundreds/thousands of nodes/assets)

## Current Model Highlights

- All major entities have `location` for map visualization
- Assets (trucks, ships, airplanes) are first-class citizens
- Routes reference node IDs for easy lookup and visualization
- Orders, events, and demand are modeled for dynamic simulation
- Extensible for new asset types, constraints, and KPIs

## Next Steps

- Populate with a larger, more realistic network
- Implement a simulation loop (advance time, move assets, process orders)
- Integrate reward calculation and event logging
- Update frontend to visualize all entity types
- Add scenario management and what-if analysis

## Roadmap for Enterprise-Scale Supply Chain Simulation

1. **Iterate on the Data Model**
   - Continue evolving `supplyChainNext.ts` as your “source of truth” for all entities (factories, DCs, retails, trucks, ships, airplanes, routes, orders, events, etc.).
   - Add real-world fields as needed (e.g., fuel status, emissions, maintenance, port/airport codes, etc.).
   - Normalize relationships (use IDs for references, not nested objects).

2. **Simulation Engine**
   - Implement a time-stepped simulation loop (tick-based or event-driven) that updates the state (moves assets, processes orders, updates inventory, triggers events).
   - Add event logging for every significant change (stockout, shipment, delay, etc.).
   - Support “what-if” scenarios by snapshotting and restoring state.

3. **Reward System Integration**
   - Track all reward variables in your state (costs, lead times, risks, emissions, etc.).
   - Implement reward calculation functions that can score any candidate plan or action.
   - Expose reward breakdowns for explainability in the UI.

4. **Scalable Backend**
   - Move state to a database (Postgres, Cosmos DB, etc.) if you need persistence or very large scale.
   - Add APIs for querying, updating, and simulating state (REST or GraphQL).

5. **Visualization & UI**
   - Update your map view to use the new model (`supplyChainNext.ts`), showing all entity types (trucks, ships, airplanes, etc.).
   - Add filtering, clustering, and drill-downs for large networks.
   - Show routes, disruptions, and recommendations visually.

6. **AI/Reasoning Integration**
   - Feed the full, rich state to your reasoning engine (Azure OpenAI, etc.).
   - Let the AI propose actions, which you simulate and score.
   - Show reasoning and reward breakdowns in the UI.

7. **Enterprise Features**
   - Multi-user support, roles, and permissions.
   - Scenario management (save/load/share scenarios).
   - Performance optimization for large-scale runs.

### Suggested Next Steps

- Populate `supplyChainNext.ts` with a larger, more realistic network (dozens of nodes, assets, SKUs, etc.).
- Write a simulation loop that advances time and updates state.
- Update your frontend to visualize the new model (start with just factories, DCs, retails, trucks, and routes).
- Add event logging and a simple reward calculation.
- Iterate: Add more complexity (demand, orders, disruptions, new asset types, etc.).

## Choosing the Right Scale for Enterprise Supply Chain Demos

When designing a demo for enterprise-scale supply chain reasoning, it's important to balance realism, complexity, and clarity. Here are guidelines and best practices:

### Recommended Globe/Map Scale

- **Maritime/Cargo Ship Demo (e.g., Suez Canal Blocked):**
  - Use a global or intercontinental map (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia, Middle East).
  - Show major ports (Shanghai, Rotterdam, LA, NY, Singapore, Dubai, etc.).
  - Include key maritime routes (Suez Canal, Panama Canal, Cape of Good Hope, etc.).
  - Show a handful of ships, factories, and destination ports.
  - Example: 5-10 ships, 10-20 ports, 3-5 major disruptions (canal blocked, port closed, storm).

- **Air Cargo/Airplanes:**
  - 2-5 airplanes connecting major airports (e.g., Shanghai, Frankfurt, Chicago, Dubai). Use for expedited shipments or as a disruption mitigation option. Visualize air routes and airport nodes on the map.

- **Trucks, Factories, Retail (Land-based):**
  - Use a regional or national map (e.g., US, EU, China).
  - Show 3-5 factories, 5-10 DCs, 10-20 retail nodes.
  - 10-20 trucks moving between nodes.
  - Simulate disruptions like highway closures, factory shutdowns, or DC stockouts.

- **Combined Demo:**
  - Show a global map, but focus on a few “lanes” (e.g., Shanghai → Suez → Rotterdam → Berlin retail).
  - Let users zoom in to see truck/retail detail in a region (e.g., Europe or US).
  - Simulate a Suez Canal block and show how it ripples through the network (rerouting ships, delayed trucks, stockouts at retail).

### How to Get AI Reasoning for Suez Canal Blockage

1. **State Representation:**
   - Mark the Suez Canal route as “closed” in your routes data.
   - Show affected ships, ports, and downstream nodes.

2. **AI Reasoning Prompt:**
   - “The Suez Canal is blocked. Ship X carrying SKU Y is delayed. What are the best options to minimize impact on European retail stores?”
   - Pass the current state (including the disruption) to your reasoning engine.

3. **Expected AI Recommendations:**
   - Reroute ships via Cape of Good Hope (longer, more expensive).
   - Expedite air freight for critical SKUs.
   - Rebalance inventory from US or other unaffected regions.
   - Prioritize high-value or perishable goods for alternate transport.

### Demo Value Sweet Spot

- **Global for ships, regional for trucks/retail.**
- **~20-50 nodes total** (factories, DCs, ports, retail).
- **5-10 ships, 10-20 trucks, 2-5 airplanes.**
- **2-3 major disruptions** (canal, port, highway, airport).
- **Clear, visual impact** of disruptions and AI recommendations.

**Summary:**

- Use a global map for maritime and air cargo, regional for land.
- 20-50 nodes, 10-30 assets is “just right” for demo.
- Simulate Suez Canal block by closing that route and asking the AI for rerouting/mitigation strategies.
- Show how disruptions cascade through the network and how the AI helps recover.
