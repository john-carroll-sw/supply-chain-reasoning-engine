# Supply Chain Next: Iteration Notes

## Vision

- Move from a simple, flat supply chain model to an enterprise-scale, extensible, and time-aware simulation.
- Support for factories, DCs, retails, trucks, ships, airplanes, SKUs, orders, events, and more.
- Enable advanced reasoning, optimization, and reward-based decision making.

## Key Design Principles

- **Normalized, modular data model** (see `supplyChainNext.ts`)
- **Time-stepped simulation** with event logging
- **Support for all asset types** (trucks, ships, airplanes, etc.)
- **Reward system** for optimization and explainability (see `Rewards.md`)
- **Scalable for large networks** (hundreds/thousands of nodes/assets)

## Current Model Highlights

- All major entities have `location` for map visualization
- Assets (trucks, ships, airplanes) are first-class citizens
- Routes reference node IDs for easy lookup and visualization
- Orders, events, and demand are modeled for dynamic simulation
- Extensible for new asset types, constraints, and KPIs

## Next Steps

- Populate with a larger, more realistic network
- Implement a simulation loop (advance time, move assets, process orders)
- Integrate reward calculation and event logging
- Update frontend to visualize all entity types
- Add scenario management and what-if analysis

## Roadmap for Enterprise-Scale Supply Chain Simulation

1. **Iterate on the Data Model**
   - Continue evolving `supplyChainNext.ts` as your “source of truth” for all entities (factories, DCs, retails, trucks, ships, airplanes, routes, orders, events, etc.).
   - Add real-world fields as needed (e.g., fuel status, emissions, maintenance, port/airport codes, etc.).
   - Normalize relationships (use IDs for references, not nested objects).

2. **Simulation Engine**
   - Implement a time-stepped simulation loop (tick-based or event-driven) that updates the state (moves assets, processes orders, updates inventory, triggers events).
   - Add event logging for every significant change (stockout, shipment, delay, etc.).
   - Support “what-if” scenarios by snapshotting and restoring state.

3. **Reward System Integration**
   - Track all reward variables in your state (costs, lead times, risks, emissions, etc.).
   - Implement reward calculation functions that can score any candidate plan or action.
   - Expose reward breakdowns for explainability in the UI.

4. **Scalable Backend**
   - Move state to a database (Postgres, Cosmos DB, etc.) if you need persistence or very large scale.
   - Add APIs for querying, updating, and simulating state (REST or GraphQL).

5. **Visualization & UI**
   - Update your map view to use the new model (`supplyChainNext.ts`), showing all entity types (trucks, ships, airplanes, etc.).
   - Add filtering, clustering, and drill-downs for large networks.
   - Show routes, disruptions, and recommendations visually.

6. **AI/Reasoning Integration**
   - Feed the full, rich state to your reasoning engine (Azure OpenAI, etc.).
   - Let the AI propose actions, which you simulate and score.
   - Show reasoning and reward breakdowns in the UI.

7. **Enterprise Features**
   - Multi-user support, roles, and permissions.
   - Scenario management (save/load/share scenarios).
   - Performance optimization for large-scale runs.

### Suggested Next Steps

- Populate `supplyChainNext.ts` with a larger, more realistic network (dozens of nodes, assets, SKUs, etc.).
- Write a simulation loop that advances time and updates state.
- Update your frontend to visualize the new model (start with just factories, DCs, retails, trucks, and routes).
- Add event logging and a simple reward calculation.
- Iterate: Add more complexity (demand, orders, disruptions, new asset types, etc.).
